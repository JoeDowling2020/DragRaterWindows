<h1>Joe Dowling Individual Project Enterprise Java 2021</h1>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
Choosing your favorite Drag Queen can be challenging. There are so many factors to consider. From subjective opinion to cold statistics this website aims to combine user entered data with existing stats to give the user an individual ranking system that they can compare to other users. There is nothing along these lines currently available on the internet and partly due to quarantine Ru Paul’s Drag Race has seen a large boost in viewership and popularity!
The goal of this project is to create a fun and interactive space to meet other fans of the show and trade opinions on who truly is the best.
